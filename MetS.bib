 abstract = {Understanding of the long-term clinical outcomes associated with bariatric surgery has recently been advanced. Research related to the sequelae of diabetes-in particular, long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications-in patients who undergo weight-loss surgery is imperative to this pursuit. While numerous randomized control trials have assessed glucose control with bariatric surgery compared with intensive medical therapy, bariatric surgery outcome data relating to microvascular and macrovascular complications have been limited to observational studies and nonrandomized clinical trials. As a result, whether bariatric surgery is associated with a long-term reduction in microvascular and macrovascular complications when compared with current intensive glycemic control therapy cannot be determined because the evidence is insufficient. However, the consistent salutary effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes remission and glycemic improvement support the opportunity (and need) to conduct high-quality studies of bariatric surgery versus intensive glucose control. This review provides relevant background information related to the treatment of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and long-term complications; reports clinical findings (to date) with bariatric surgery; and identifies ongoing research focusing on long-term vascular outcomes associated with bariatric surgery.},

 abstract = {Bariatric surgery is well-recognized for its effects on health, beyond weight-loss. It underwent a revolution recently with the growing performance of laparoscopic procedures, leading to enhanced recovery and a reduction in procedural risk. However, surgical complications, although rare, do develop. It is important to recognize the complications, and ideally prevent them from happening. This article reviews the risks of the four most commonly performed bariatric procedures, with an emphasis on technique and management in the intraoperative and postoperative period. The nutritional aspect of bariatric surgery is of the utmost importance, because catastrophic consequences have been linked to malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is often linked to overweight/obesity and can improve after weight loss, such improvement is expected to be proportional to the intensity of weight loss. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery (BS) on the prevalence of MS in a middle-term period. METHODS: Thirty-five (35) patients who underwent surgical Roux's Y gastrojejunal by-pass from October 2001 until October 2005 in our University Hospital were evaluated. 88.5{\%} were female, with a mean age at the time of surgery of 37.8+/-11.1 years and a mean BMI of 45.0+/-6.2 Kg/m(2). During the first stage of our study demographic and clinical-anthropomorphic data were collected prior to the BC procedure, including those criteria needed for the diagnosis of MS, according to the guidelines of the US NCEP. The second stage consisted of reevaluation of those patients in the post-surgical period in order to determine the prevalence of MS in an outpatient setting. RESULTS: Prior to surgery, MS was diagnosed in 27 patients (77.1{\%}). When those patients were reevaluated 34.4+/-15 months after surgery, a reduction of mean BMI to 28.3+/-5.0 Kg/m(2) and MS was identified in only two patients (5.7{\%}) (p{\textless}0.001). Prevalence of individual criteria such as abdominal circumference, fasting glucose levels, arterial blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides had a reduction of 45.8{\%}, 83{\%}, 87.5{\%}, 57.13{\%} and 94{\%} respectively. CONCLUSION: MS is a rather common feature in obese patients enrolled for BS and this procedure has been proved to be extremely efficient reversing the metabolic syndrome, with an expressive reduction of prevalence of each and all of the NCEP criteria.},

 abstract = {Obesity and diabetes represent twin health concerns in the developed world. Metabolic surgery has emerged as an established and enduring treatment for both obesity and diabetes. As the burden of obesity and diabetes varies upon the basis of ethnicity, it is also apparent that there may be differences for indications and outcomes for different ethnic groups after metabolic surgery. Whereas there appears to be evidence for variation in weight loss and complications for different ethnic groups, comorbidity remission particularly for diabetes appears to be free of ethnic disparity after metabolic surgery. The impacts of access, biology, culture, genetics, procedure, and socioeconomic status upon metabolic surgery outcomes are examined. Further refinement of the influence of ethnicity upon metabolic surgery outcomes is likely imminent.},

The aim of this study was to assess the impact and predictors of bariatric surgery on the resolution of MS. METHODS: Subjects included 286 patients [age 44.0 +/- 11.5, female 78.2{\%}, BMI 48.7 +/- 9.4, waist circumference 139 +/- 20 cm, AST 23.5 +/- 14.9, ALT 30.0 +/- 20.1, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) 30.1{\%} and MS 39.2{\%}] who underwent bariatric surgery. RESULTS: Of the entire cohort, 27.3{\%} underwent malabsorptive surgery, 55.9{\%} underwent restrictive surgery, and 16.8{\%} had combination restrictive-malabsorptive surgery. Mean weight loss was 33.7 +/- 20.1 kg after restrictive surgery (follow up period 298 +/- 271 days), 39.4 +/- 22.9 kg after malabsorptive surgery (follow-up period 306 +/- 290 days), and 28.3 +/- 14.1 kg after combination surgery (follow-up period 281 +/- 239 days). Regardless of the type of bariatric surgery, significant improvements were noted in MS (p values from {\textless}0.0001-0.01) as well as its components such as DM (p values from {\textless}0.0001-0.0005), waist circumference (p values {\textless}0.0001), BMI (p values {\textless}0.0001), fasting serum triglycerides (p values {\textless}0.0001 to 0.001), and fasting serum glucose (p values {\textless}0.0001). Additionally, a significant improvement in AST/ALT ratio (p value = 0.0002) was noted in those undergoing restrictive surgery. Multivariate analysis showed that patients who underwent malabsorptive bariatric procedures experienced a significantly greater percent excess weight loss than patients who underwent restrictive procedures (p value = 0.0451). Percent excess weight loss increased with longer postoperative follow-up (p value {\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss after bariatric surgery is associated with a significant improvement in MS and other metabolic factors.},

 abstract = {South Asia is home to one of the largest population of people with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The prevalence of MetS in South Asians varies according to region, extent of urbanization, lifestyle patterns, and socioeconomic/cultural factors. Recent data show that about one-third of the urban population in large cities in India has the MetS. All classical risk factors comprising the MetS are prevalent in Asian Indians residing in India. The higher risk in this ethnic population necessitated a lowering of the cut-off values of the risk factors to identify and intervene for the MetS to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Some pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are underway in MetS to assess the efficacy in preventing the diabetes and cardiovascular disease in this ethnic population.},

@article{Phillips.2015,
 abstract = {The rate of gastric emptying is a critical determinant of postprandial glycaemia and, accordingly, is fundamental to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. Disordered gastric emptying occurs frequently in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A complex bidirectional relationship exists between gastric emptying and glycaemia--gastric emptying accounts for approximately 35{\%} of the variance in peak postprandial blood glucose concentrations in healthy individuals and in patients with diabetes mellitus, and the rate of emptying is itself modulated by acute changes in glycaemia. Clinical implementation of incretin-based therapies for the management of T2DM, which diminish postprandial glycaemia, in part by slowing gastric emptying, is widespread. Other therapies for patients with T2DM, which specifically target gastric emptying include pramlintide and dietary-based treatment approaches. A weak association exists between upper gastrointestinal symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying. In patients with severe diabetic gastroparesis, pathological changes are highly variable and are characterized by loss of interstitial cells of Cajal and an immune infiltrate. Management options for patients with symptomatic gastroparesis remain limited in their efficacy, which probably reflects the heterogeneous nature of the underlying pathophysiology.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in children. It is linked to obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MS), predisposing to future cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effects that weight loss achieved with laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) has on the metabolic parameters and NAFLD scores of obese adolescents with evidence of fatty liver disease. METHODS: Adolescents undergoing LAGB were evaluated for NAFLD with evidence of fatty liver on preoperative sonogram, serum biochemistry, or both between 2005 and 2011. Primary endpoint was change in NAFLD scores after LAGB and secondary endpoint change in MS criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-six out of 155 adolescents had evidence of fatty liver disease at presentation. The group consisted of 17 (30{\%}) male and 39 (70{\%}) females, mean age 16.1 years (range 14-17.8 yr). Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 48.8 kg/m(2) (+/-7) dropping to 37.9 kg/m(2) (+/-8.3) at 12 months and 36.8 kg/m(2) (+/-8.2) at 24 months. Fifteen (27{\%}) patients met the criteria for MS. When comparing 1-year postsurgery to presurgery, the NAFLD score decreased by an average of .68 (SD = 1.03, P{\textless}.01). The 2-year NAFLD score decreased by a mean of .38 (SD = .99, P = .01). The reoperation rate for band/port related complications was 10.7{\%} at 2 years with no mortality. MS rates improved from 27{\%} to 2{\%} at 2 years (P{\textless} .01). CONCLUSIONS: LAGB is a safe and effective operation for obese adolescents with NAFLD. There was significant improvement in NAFLD scores and resolution of MS.},

@article{Remedios.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery numbers have seen a sharp rise in India in the last decade. A country known for its undernourished population has seen economic growth and with it, greater influence of western culture and foods. The obesity epidemic is on the rise here and India is one of the 10 most obese nations of the world being second only to China in the number of type 2 diabetes. Nutritionists in India often rely on recommendations and guidelines meant for the Caucasian population. Religious and cultural practices influence the dietary habits and patterns of the Indian population to a great extent; because of which the nutritional requirements are very different. This document was put together with an aim to provide nutritionists with recommendations on how to manage the Indian bariatric patient. METHODS: A bariatric nutrition round table meeting was initiated by the Centre for Obesity and Digestive Surgery (CODS) to bring together experts in the field of bariatric nutrition to review current data on nutritional deficiencies in the morbid obese and existing post-operative deficiencies and to formulate nutritional recommendations for bariatric/metabolic surgery specific to patients from India. RESULTS: Percentage of nutritional deficiencies and reasons for the same were identified among the Indian population and recommendations were made to suit this particular population. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that all patients undergo compulsory pre-operative nutritional counseling and nutritional investigations and that nutritional follow-up be continued lifelong. In addition, long-term implications like hypoglycemia, dumping syndrome, sugar cravings, and weight regain, need to be picked up and managed efficiently. Most importantly, post-operative supplementation is a must irrespective of type of surgery.},

@article{Rubin.2016,
 abstract = {Despite increasing recognition of the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of bariatric/metabolic surgery in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, few patients who may be appropriate candidates and may benefit from this type of surgery avail themselves of this treatment option. To identify conceptual and practical barriers to appropriate use of surgical procedures, a Policy Lab was hosted at the 3rd World Congress on Interventional Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes on 29 September 2015. Twenty-six stakeholders participated in the Policy Lab, including academics, clinicians, policy-makers, industry leaders, and patient representatives. Participants were provided with a summary of available evidence about the cost-effectiveness of bariatric/metabolic surgery and the costs of increasing the use of bariatric/metabolic surgery, using U.K. and U.S. scenarios as examples of distinct health care systems. There was widespread agreement among this group of stakeholders that bariatric/metabolic surgery is a legitimate and cost-effective approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in obese patients. The following four building blocks were identified to facilitate policy changes: 1) communicating the scale of the costs and harms associated with rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes; 2) properly articulating the role of bariatric/metabolic surgery for certain population groups; 3) identifying new funding sources for bariatric/metabolic surgery; and 4) incorporating bariatric/metabolic surgery into the appropriate clinical pathways. Although more research is needed to identify specific clinical scenarios for the prioritization of bariatric/metabolic surgery, the case appears to be strong enough to engage relevant policy-makers and practitioners in a concerted discussion of how to better use metabolic surgical resources in conjunction with other interventions in good diabetes practice.},

@article{Rubino.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite growing evidence that bariatric/metabolic surgery powerfully improves type 2 diabetes (T2D), existing diabetes treatment algorithms do not include surgical options. AIM: The 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS-II), an international consensus conference, was convened in collaboration with leading diabetes organizations to develop global guidelines to inform clinicians and policymakers about benefits and limitations of metabolic surgery for T2D. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 48 international clinicians/scholars (75{\%} nonsurgeons), including representatives of leading diabetes organizations, participated in DSS-II. After evidence appraisal (MEDLINE [1 January 2005-30 September 2015]), three rounds of Delphi-like questionnaires were used to measure consensus for 32 data-based conclusions. These drafts were presented at the combined DSS-II and 3rd World Congress on Interventional Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes (London, U.K., 28-30 September 2015), where they were open to public comment by other professionals and amended face-to-face by the Expert Committee. RESULTS: Given its role in metabolic regulation, the gastrointestinal tract constitutes a meaningful target to manage T2D. Numerous randomized clinical trials, albeit mostly short/midterm, demonstrate that metabolic surgery achieves excellent glycemic control and reduces cardiovascular risk factors. On the basis of such evidence, metabolic surgery should be recommended to treat T2D in patients with class III obesity (BMI {\textgreater}/=40 kg/m(2)) and in those with class II obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m(2)) when hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled by lifestyle and optimal medical therapy. Surgery should also be considered for patients with T2D and BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2) if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal treatment with either oral or injectable medications. These BMI thresholds should be reduced by 2.5 kg/m(2) for Asian patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although additional studies are needed to further demonstrate long-term benefits, there is sufficient clinical and mechanistic evidence to support inclusion of metabolic surgery among antidiabetes interventions for people with T2D and obesity. To date, the DSS-II guidelines have been formally endorsed by 45 worldwide medical and scientific societies. Health care regulators should introduce appropriate reimbursement policies.},

 abstract = {Several conventional methods of bariatric surgery can induce long-term remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); novel gastrointestinal surgical procedures are reported to have similar effects. These procedures also dramatically improve other metabolic conditions, including hyperlipidemia and hypertension, in both obese and nonobese patients. Several studies have provided evidence that these metabolic effects are not simply the results of drastic weight loss and decreased caloric intake but might be attributable, in part, to endocrine changes resulting from surgical manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract. In this Review, we provide an overview of the clinical evidence that demonstrates the effects of such interventions-termed metabolic surgery-on T2DM and discuss the implications for future research. In light of the evidence presented here, we speculate that the gastrointestinal tract might have a role in the pathophysiology of T2DM and obesity.},

@article{Schauer.2016,
 abstract = {Since the 2007 Diabetes Surgery Summit in Rome, Italy, and the subsequent publishing of the world's first guidelines for the surgical treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), much new evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of metabolic surgery has emerged. Additional observational cohort studies support the superior effects of surgery over medical treatment with respect to glycemic control, weight loss, and even reduction in mortality and microvascular complications associated with T2D. Furthermore, new safety data suggest that the perioperative morbidity and mortality of metabolic surgery (5{\%} and 0.3{\%}, respectively) are now similar to that of common low-risk procedures, such as cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. The largest advance, however, has been the completion of 11 randomized controlled trials from around the globe that compare surgery with medical treatment of T2D. These studies with follow-up duration of 1-5 years involve nearly 800 patients without surgical mortality and with major complication rates of less than 5{\%} and a reoperation rate of 8{\%}. All but 1 of the 11 randomized controlled trials have shown the superiority of surgery over medical management at achieving remission or glycemic improvement. Surgery was also superior to medical treatment with respect to improving cardiovascular risk factors, such as weight loss and dyslipidemia, while reducing medication burden. This new efficacy and safety evidence should help guide physicians across the globe to the appropriate use of surgery as an effective treatment for patients suffering from T2D and obesity.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome (MS) in the preoperative period in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 68 medical records of patients from a center for advanced treatment of obesity in the city of Caxias do Sul, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, were reviewed. The variables analyzed were gender, age, biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides), abdominal ultrasound, blood pressure, and anthropometric data (weight, height, waist circumference, and body mass index [BMI]). The diagnosis of NAFLD was obtained by abdominal ultrasonography; the diagnosis of of MS was obtained according to the protocol described by the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III, updated by the American Heart Association; and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. RESULTS: 72.1{\%} (n=49) of the sample consisted of females, and the mean age for the sample was 37.57+/-10.29 years. The mean weight was 123.14+/-25.40kg, mean height was 1.67+/-0.09 m, and mean BMI was 56.24+/-9.30kg/m(2). A total of 60{\%} (n=27) of patients with MS (p=0.008), 63.4{\%} (n=26) of patients with hypertension (p=0.013), and 66.7{\%} (n=18) of patients with altered glucose levels (p=0.028) were diagnosed with NAFLD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the diagnosis of MS, as well as the presence of disorders associated with this syndrome (obesity, hypertension, and high blood glucose levels) are strongly associated with the presence of NAFLD.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 190 patients, 150 women (79{\%}) and 40 men (21{\%}) diagnosed with MO and surgically treated at our Hospital (Capella's gastric bypass). Mean age of the patients was 36.5 years (range: 18.5-54.5). Anthropometric values are gathered: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and biochemistry: insulin (INS), glucose (GLU), total proteins (TP), albumin (ALB), transferrin (TRF), ferritin (FER), prealbumin (PBA), retinol binding protein (RBP) and C reactive protein (CRP). The HOMA index was calculated before the bypass and at the following follow-up periods after bypass: 6, 12, 60 and 84 months. RESULTS: Abdominal ultrasound suggesting NAFLD or NASH was found in 34.7{\%} (n = 66; 52 women and 14 men) of MO patients surgically treated. Ninety patients (47.3{\%}; 67 women and 23 men) presented risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MS). All patients with possible liver dysfunction had MS. Before the bypass, we found increased levels of: BMI, WC, CRP, GLU, INS and HOMA index and changes in TP, ALB, PBA, RBP, FER and TRF levels. The first set of parameters start to decrease within 6 months after surgical bypass and at the same time the changes in protein levels start to face off and remain stable at 84 months. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss due to bariatric surgery represents an effective method of fighting MO and its associated comorbidities (NAFLD, NASH, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and components of the metabolic syndrome).},

 abstract = {With the many recent advances in the biomedical world, vast changes are taking place in our growing knowledge of the physiological aspects of almost all the tissues and organs of the human body. One of the most prevalent topics of discussion is the question of obesity and its effect on the metabolic changes in the human body. The original classical role of adipose tissue as an energy storage organ has been greatly modified. We now know that it is an endocrine organ, producing adipokines like leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, resistin, apelin, etc, which modulate metabolic processes in the body. Since obesity is associated with an increase in the adipose tissue mass, these hormones may be expected to be produced in increased concentrations and may thus have a significant impact on the macronutrient metabolism. Further, these adipokines may interact with long term energy modulators like insulin. Even though the scientific community has started unravelling the mysteries of the close linkage between obesity, its hormones and their physiological effects, a lot still remains to be discovered. The present discussion makes an attempt to trace the basic modern day concepts of the role of obesity in various metabolic processes.},

STUDY DESIGN: Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database, the national database for the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence Program, was queried to identify patients undergoing bariatric surgery from June 2007 through November 2010. MetS was defined as the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia at presentation for bariatric surgery. Ninety-day and 1-year outcomes were assessed to determine early outcomes in bariatric surgery patients with MetS. RESULTS: Among 186,576 research-consented patients, 23,106 (12{\%}) were diagnosed with MetS. Patients with MetS were more likely to be male (35{\%} vs 20{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001), older (mean age 54 vs 44 years; p {\textless} 0.0001), and Caucasian (81{\%} vs 74{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001). Of the 23,106 MetS patients, more underwent gastric bypass (RYGB) (62{\%}) compared with gastric banding (32{\%}), sleeve gastrectomy (4.5{\%}), and biliopancreactic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS)(1.5{\%}). MetS patients had an increase in serious complications (2.4{\%} vs 1.0{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001), readmissions (6.2{\%} vs 4.7{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001), and mortality (0.3{\%} vs 0.1{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001) within 90 days of operation. After adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index, RYGB patients with MetS had an increased risk of 90-day serious complications compared to RYGB patients without MetS (odds ratio 1.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.27 to 1.61; p {\textless} 0.0001). The 12-month remission rate of diabetes was least for gastric banding (28{\%}) compared with the other procedures (RYGB 62{\%}, sleeve gastrectomy 52{\%}, BPD/DS 74{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MetS undergoing bariatric surgery showed dramatic improvement in diabetes 1-year after surgery; however, an adverse 90-day outcome was more common.},

Current treatment of NAFLD is based on weight reduction. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and its associated metabolic comorbidities. There is evidence indicating that bariatric surgery improves histological and biochemical parameters of NAFLD, but currently is not considered a treatment option for NAFLD. The aim of this work is to review the evidence for the effects of bariatric surgery on NAFLD and the MetS. We found that insulin resistance, alterations in glucose metabolism, hypertension, plasma lipids, transaminases, liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis improve after bariatric surgery. Weight loss and improvement of NAFLD are greater after RYGB than after other interventions. These findings were obtained from retrospective or cohort studies. There are no studies designed to evaluate liver-specific mortality, liver transplantation, or quality of life. Patients with indications for bariatric surgery will benefit from the improvements in the MetS and NAFLD.},

@article{Batsis.2008,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of weight loss by bariatric surgery on the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and to examine predictors of MetS resolution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a population-based, retrospective study of patients evaluated for bariatric surgery between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2003, who had MetS as defined by the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (increased triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein, increased blood pressure, increased fasting glucose, and a measure of obesity). Of these patients, 180 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 157 were assessed in a weight-reduction program but did not undergo surgery. We determined the change in MetS prevalence and used logistic regression models to determine predictors of MetS resolution. Mean follow-up was 3.4 years. RESULTS: In the surgical group, all MetS components improved, and medication use decreased. Nonsurgical patients showed improvements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. After bariatric surgery, the number of patients with MetS decreased from 156 (87{\%}) of 180 patients to 53 (29{\%}); of the 157 nonsurgical patients, MetS prevalence decreased from 133 patients (85{\%}) to 117 (75{\%}). A relative risk reduction of 0.59 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.67; P{\textless}.001) was observed in patients who underwent bariatric surgery and had MetS at follow-up. The number needed to treat with surgery to resolve 1 case of MetS was 2.1. Results were similar after excluding patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease or after using diagnostic criteria other than body mass index for MetS. Significant predictors of MetS resolution included a 5{\%} loss in excess weight (odds ratio, 1.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.19-1.34; P{\textless}.001) and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 0.32; 95{\%} CI, 0.15-0.68; P=.003). CONCLUSION: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induces considerable and persistent improvement in MetS prevalence. Our results suggest that reversibility of MetS depends more on the amount of excess weight lost than on other parameters.},

@article{Batterham.2016,
 abstract = {More than 20 years ago, Pories et al. published a seminal article, {\dq}Who Would Have Thought It? An Operation Proves to Be the Most Effective Therapy for Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus.{\dq} This was based on their observation that bariatric surgery rapidly normalized blood glucose levels in obese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 10 years later, almost 90{\%} remained diabetes free. Pories et al. suggested that caloric restriction played a key role and that the relative contributions of proximal intestinal nutrient exclusion, rapid distal gut nutrient delivery, and the role of gut hormones required further investigation. These findings of T2DM improvement/remission after bariatric surgery have been widely replicated, together with the observation that bariatric surgery prevents or delays incident T2DM. Over the ensuing two decades, important glucoregulatory roles of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been firmly established. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial glycemic effects of bariatric surgery remain incompletely understood. In addition to the mechanisms proposed by Pories et al., changes in bile acid metabolism, GI tract nutrient sensing and glucose utilization, incretins, possible anti-incretin(s), and the intestinal microbiome are implicated. These changes, acting through peripheral and/or central pathways, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, increased tissue glucose uptake, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced beta-cell function. A constellation of factors, rather than a single overarching mechanism, likely mediate postoperative glycemic improvement, with the contributing factors varying according to the surgical procedure. Thus, different bariatric/metabolic procedures provide us with experimental tools to probe GI tract physiology. Embracing this approach through the application of detailed phenotyping, genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome studies will enhance our understanding of metabolic regulation and help identify novel therapeutic targets.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the metabolic syndrome (MS) and what are the criteria that contribute the most for its exclusion after surgery. The progress of leucometry was also analyzed. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: 47 obese women with MS were evaluated. All patients were operated with the Roux-en-Y vertical gastric bypass technique, with the insertion of a contention ring on the gastro-jejune anastomosis (Fobi-Capella). Patients were evaluated before and on the first year post-surgery. RESULTS: Fasting glucose presented a relevant decrease at 3 months after surgery. After 12 months, all 20 patients who had DM2 or altered fasting glucose presented normal levels of fasting glucose and glicated hemoglobin, and none of them was using any anti-diabetic drug. Triglycerides levels were reduced by 49.2{\%}, whereas HDL-cholesterol increased by 27.2{\%}. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced by an average of 28.7 and 20.8 mmHg, respectively. Leucocytes counting fell from 7671/microL to 6156/microL. Fasting glucose, triglycerides, DBP, SBP and HDL-cholesterol were the variables that contributed most for the reduction of MS. At the end of the first year, elimination of MS occurred in 80.9{\%} of the patients. DISCUSSION: Bariatric surgery reduces resistance to insulin and consequently the cardiovascular risk factors.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of metabolic syndrome and its resolution in a large, ethnically diverse adult population undergoing bariatric surgery. BACKGROUND: There is still limited knowledge about the impact of bariatric surgery on chronic health conditions such as metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Adults having had a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy between 2007 and 2009 (n = 4088) without revision during the study period of January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011 were eligible for the study. Diagnosis and resolution of metabolic syndrome were determined using standard criteria with electronic medical records of laboratory, diagnosis, and pharmacy information. RESULTS: Patients were primarily women (82{\%}), non-Hispanic black (17{\%}) or Hispanic (32{\%}), 45 +/- 11 years old, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 47.10 +/- 7.73 kg/m at the time of surgery. After multivariate adjustment, metabolic syndrome was less likely to resolve in patients if they had a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy procedure and a higher BMI at surgery, were older, were male or were either Hispanic or non-Hispanic black. The effects of age, race/ethnicity, and BMI at the time of surgery remained after accounting for weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings, bariatric surgery may be most effective for younger, less obese patients who are early in the course of their cardiometabolic disease. Future research should investigate the factors that lead to lower rates of disease resolution after bariatric surgery for racial/ethnic minority groups.},

@article{Cummings.2016,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Global usage of bariatric surgery has been dictated for the past quarter century by National Institutes of Health recommendations restricting these operations to individuals with a BMI {\textgreater}/=35 kg/m(2). Strong evidence now demonstrates that bariatric procedures markedly improve or cause remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in part through weight-independent mechanisms, and that baseline BMI does not predict surgical benefits on glycemic or cardiovascular outcomes. This impels consideration of such operations as {\dq}metabolic surgery,{\dq} which is used expressly to treat T2DM, including among patients with a BMI {\textless}35 kg/m(2) who constitute the majority of people with diabetes worldwide. Here, we review available evidence to inform that consideration. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of the 11 published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) directly comparing bariatric/metabolic surgery versus a variety of medical/lifestyle interventions for T2DM provides level 1A evidence that surgery is superior for T2DM remission, glycemic control, and HbA1c lowering. Importantly, this is equally true for patients whose baseline BMI is below or above 35 kg/m(2). Similar conclusions derive from meta-analyses of high-quality nonrandomized prospective comparisons. Meta-analysis of all pertinent published studies indicates that T2DM remission rates following bariatric/metabolic surgery are comparable above and below the 35 kg/m(2) BMI threshold. The safety, antidiabetes durability, and benefits on other cardiovascular risk factors from bariatric/metabolic surgery appear roughly comparable among patients with a BMI below or above 35 kg/m(2). Further studies are needed to extend long-term findings and measure {\dq}hard{\dq} macrovascular/microvascular outcomes and mortality in RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: Extant data, including level 1A evidence from numerous RCTs, support new guidelines from the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit that advocate for the consideration of bariatric/metabolic surgery as one option, along with lifestyle and medical therapy, to treat T2DM among patients with a BMI {\textless}35 kg/m(2).},

To evaluate the effects of metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese patients and body mass reduction secondary to gastric bypass surgery on convenient and new non-invasive markers of artery function: pulse wave velocity (PWV), flow- and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (FMD, NTG). METHODS: There were 40 patients included into prospective study, who were qualified for bariatric surgery (OB1) and evaluated again 6 m after surgery (OB2). A control group (CG) consisted of 15 healthy women. A second control group (CG2) consisted of 15 women with grade 1 obesity. PWV, FMD, NTG were assessed. RESULTS: The reduction of BMI (kg/m(2)) from 47.73 +/- 6.18 (OB1) to 35.22 +/- 5.20 (OB2) was observed. The PWV turned out to be higher before bariatric surgery (OB1 vs. OB2 8.53 +/- 1.76 vs. 7.82 +/- 1.49 m/s; p {\textless} 0.001), however it was no different than PWV in CG. In OB1 group PWV showed correlation with age (r = 0.492, p = 0.001), HR (r = 0.324, p = 0.04), {\%}FM (r = 0.328; p = 0.039), NTG{\%} (r = -0.332, p = 0.036) as well as hsCRP (r = 0.394, p = 0.014). A multivariate analysis showed that the most significant factors influencing PWV were age (p = 0.0005) and hsCRP (p = 0.0014), pseudo R(2) index 0.44365. The values of FMD differed between OB1 and OB2 groups (12.83 +/- 5.15 vs. 17.52 +/- 5.50 {\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001), however, they were similar to results obtained in CG (14.45 +/- 6.14 {\%}; NS). The values of nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation differed between OB1 and OB2 groups (21.47 +/- 8.31 vs. 28.54 +/- 8.16 {\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001) and were lower as compared with CG (31.42 +/- 5.95 {\%}; p = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Body mass reduction secondary to bariatric surgery in patients with severe obesity and metabolic syndrome results in improvement of functional markers of artery function and advantageous metabolic changes. The improvement in functional markers of artery function (NTG{\%}) was correlated with change in triglyceride blood concentration.},

 abstract = {The prevalence of obesity is rising worldwide dramatically, affecting up to 50 percent of the population. The epidemic of obesity leads to a marked increase in the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors characterized by visceral obesity, insulin resistance, low HDL-Cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, and a subclinical proinflammatory state. In the last years, the NCEP and the WHO highlighted and defined the key features of the metabolic syndrome to facilitate the clinical diagnosis and preventive interventions. The conservative therapy of obesity and the metabolic syndrome by life style intervention and pharmacological interventions leads only to moderate weight loss with inconstant long-term success. Intervention by bariatric surgery can serve as a model for the metabolic effects of permanent weight loss. In several studies the pronounced weight loss induced a reduction of almost all components of the metabolic syndrome, including glucose and lipid status and is followed by an improvement in the quality of life. Recent research suggested a decrease in mortality rate in addition to cost effectiveness of bariatric surgery.},

 abstract = {The obesity epidemic, combined with the lack of available and effective treatments for morbid obesity, is a scientific and public health priority. Worldwide, bariatric and metabolic surgeries are increasingly being performed to effectively aid weight loss in patients with severe obesity, as well as because of the favourable metabolic effects of the procedures. The positive effects of bariatric surgery, especially with respect to improvements in type 2 diabetes mellitus, have expanded the eligibility criteria for metabolic surgery to patients with diabetes mellitus and a BMI of 30-35 kg/m(2). However, the limitations of BMI, both in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients, need to be considered, particularly for determining the actual adiposity and fat distribution of the patients following weight loss. Understanding the characteristics shared by bariatric and metabolic surgeries, as well as their differential aspects and outcomes, is required to enhance patient benefits and operative achievements. For a holistic approach that focuses on the multifactorial effects of bariatric and metabolic surgery to be possible, a paradigm shift that goes beyond the pure semantics is needed. Such a shift could lead to profound clinical implications for eligibility criteria and the definition of success of the surgical approach.},

@article{Geloneze.2006,
 abstract = {Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a risk condition for the development of systemic atherosclerotic disease. Morbid obesity is a state of insulin resistance (IR) associated with visceral fat accumulation, which is involved in the development of MS. In severe obesity, conservative therapies promote an improvement of MS, but weight regain is frequent, whereas bariatric surgery promotes a more significant and sustained weight loss. Bariatric surgery is recommended for patients with unsatisfactory response to clinical treatment and with IMC {\textgreater} 40 kg/m(2) or {\textgreater} 35 in case of co-morbidities. In those cases, surgical risk must be acceptable and patients submitted to surgery must be informed about complications and postoperative care. Prevention, improvement and reversion of diabetes (DM2) (70 to 90{\%} of cases) are seen in several bariatric surgery modalities. Disabsorptive are more efficient than restrictive procedures in terms of weight reduction and insulin sensitivity improvement, but chronic complications, such as malnutrition, are also more frequent. Vertical gastroplasty with jejunoileal derivation is a mixed surgery in which the restrictive component predominates. In this modality, reversion of DM2 is due to an increase in insulin sensitivity associated with improved beta cell function. Reversion of MS and its manifestations after bariatric surgery are associated with reduction of cardiovascular mortality and, thus, in severe obesity cases, MS can be considered a surgical condition.},

@article{GraciaSolanas.2011,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a lack of long-term studies for metabolic syndrome after bariatric surgery. Our aim is to show the evolution of the parameters that define the metabolic syndrome after bariatric surgery, up to 10 years of follow-up, in order to clarify what technique gets better results with fewer complications. METHODS: The IDF definition of the metabolic syndrome was used for this study. One hundred twenty-five morbid obese and superobese patients underwent vertical banded gastroplasty. Two hundred sixty-five morbid obese and superobese patients had biliopancreatic diversion (Scopinaro and modified biliopancreatic diversions), and 152 morbid obese patients underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass. A mean follow-up of up to 7 years was done in all groups. RESULTS: Prior to surgery, metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 114 patients of Scopinaro group (76{\%}), in 85 patients of modified biliopancreatic diversion group (73.9{\%}), in 81 patients of laparoscopic gastric bypass (53.4{\%}), and in 98 patients of vertical banded gastroplasty (78.4{\%}). When metabolic syndrome parameters were evaluated at 7 years of follow-up, owing to weight gain, these results changed nearby to preoperative values in both laparoscopic gastric bypass and vertical banded gastroplasty groups. CONCLUSION: According to our results, the best technique to resolve metabolic syndrome is the modified biliopancreatic diversion. Due to its high morbidity, it only must be considered in superobese patients. In obese patients, the laparoscopic gastric bypass may be a less agressive choice, but it should be coupled with lifestyle changes to keep away from the weight gain in the long run. Restrictive procedures may be indicated only in a few well-selected cases.},

@article{Halland.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Hyperglycemia is implicated as a major risk factor for delayed gastric emptying in diabetes mellitus and vice versa. However, the extent to which hyperglycemia can affect gastric emptying and vice versa and the implications for clinical practice are unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence for this bidirectional relationship and the effects of pharmacotherapy for diabetes on gastric emptying. METHODS: Full-length articles investigating the relationship between diabetes mellitus and gastroparesis were reviewed primarily to quantify the relationship between blood glucose concentrations and gastrointestinal sensorimotor functions, particularly gastric emptying, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The effects of drugs and hormones that affect glycemia on gastrointestinal sensorimotor functions were also evaluated. RESULTS: Acute severe hyperglycemia delayed gastric emptying relative to euglycemia in type 1 diabetes; the corresponding effects in type 2 diabetes are unknown. Limited evidence suggests that even mild hyperglycemia (8 mmol/L) can delay gastric emptying in type 1 diabetes. Long-term hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for delayed gastric emptying in type 1 diabetes. There is little evidence that delayed gastric emptying causes hypoglycemia in diabetes and no evidence that improved control of glycemia improves gastric emptying or vice versa. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists but not dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors given acutely delay gastric emptying, but tachyphylaxis may occur. CONCLUSIONS: Although acute severe and chronic hyperglycemia can delay gastric emptying, there is limited evidence that delayed gastric emptying is an independent risk factor for impaired glycemic control or hypoglycemia in diabetes. The impact of improved glycemic control on gastric emptying and vice versa in diabetes is unknown.},

@article{To.2012,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery is an established therapy for morbid obesity. We evaluated the effects of sleeve-gastrectomy on weight, glucose and lipid metabolism and prevalence of metabolic-syndrome for up to 2 years. METHODS: In 52 morbidly obese patients weight, BMI, total-cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, Lipoprotein(a), glucose, HbA1c, insulin, and criteria defining the metabolic-syndrome were determined preoperatively and 6 (n=52), 12 (n=41) and 24 (n=5) months after surgery. RESULTS: BMI decreased from 51+/-8 kg/m(2) to 40+/-7, 39+/-8, and 38+/-9 kg/m(2) at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Glucose and HbA1c changed from 116+/-44 to 93+/-21 and 94+/-18 mg/dl and 6.0+/-1.3 to 5.4+/-0.8 and 5.4+/-0.8{\%} at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Triglycerides decreased from 159+/-87 to 116+/-41 and 116+/-62 mg/dl, while HDL--cholesterol increased from 46+/-12 to 50+/-12 and 56+/-13 mg/dl at 6 and 12 months. None of the changes correlated with changes in weight. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome decreased from 81{\%} to 36{\%} and 34{\%} at 6 and 12 months, with individual criteria (central obesity, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, and fasting glucose) being reduced by 8/12{\%}, 31/28{\%}, 12/37{\%}, 27/30{\%}, and 38/31{\%} at 6/12 months, respectively. The decrease in triglycerides and HbA1c was more pronounced in hypertriglyceridemic patients compared to normo-triglyceridemic patients, while there was no significant difference between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study evaluating sleeve-gastrectomy in German patients. Our data indicate that sleeve-gastrectomy induces a similar metabolic improvement as malabsorptive surgery. Although metabolic improvement did not correlate with weight reduction, improvement almost exclusively occurred within the first 6 months, when significant weight reduction occurred. It is unclear whether this relates to the operative techniques or to the selection of patients.},

We assessed the in-hospital outcomes of bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients with the metabolic syndrome in comparison to a control group without the metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Using ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes, clinical data for 20,242 patients with and without the metabolic syndrome who underwent bariatric surgery over a 5-year period were obtained from the University HealthSystem Consortium database. RESULTS: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among bariatric surgery patients was 27.4{\%}. Patients with the metabolic syndrome presented significantly higher overall morbidity as compared to morbidly obese patients without the metabolic syndrome (8.6{\%} vs. 5.8{\%}; p {\textless} 0.01), and similar mortality (0.04{\%} vs. 0.01{\%}; p = 0.2) after bariatric surgery. Hispanics with the metabolic syndrome had the highest morbidity rates, and men had the uppermost mortality. In-hospital bariatric surgery outcomes were significantly improved among patients who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.
